### Goals

1. Create/Update/Delete metafields via modal
2. Implement webhooks event handlers
  - wildcard metafields update doesnt seem to work
    - make user enter namespaces to watch for?
3. Product Images/Variants should be added to display, everything should be editable
4. Search should support multiple keywords at once (seems to work out of the box)
